      label: Describe the feature
      description: What automation or script capability would you like to add? Please explain any current limitations and how you'd like it to work.
      placeholder: |
        Example: I'd like to have a "retry" option for actions that fail. Currently, if an action fails, the entire automation stops. I'd like to specify retry attempts and delays between retries.

      description: Provide specific examples of automations where this feature would be helpful.
      placeholder: |
        Example: When sending notifications to my phone, sometimes the connection fails. With retry logic, I could ensure important notifications are delivered without creating complex workarounds.

      required: true

    attributes:
      label: Current workarounds
      description: How are you handling this limitation today? (optional)
      placeholder: |
        Example: I currently use multiple automations with delays and conditions to simulate retry behavior, which is complex and hard to maintain.
