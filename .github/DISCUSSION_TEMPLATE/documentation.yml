        Example: I'd like to see a "Common Patterns" section that shows typical automation scenarios with full examples. Currently, new users struggle to understand how triggers, conditions, and actions work together because each is documented separately without complete examples. I propose adding a new section with 10-15 complete automation examples, progressing from simple to complex, with explanations of why each part is needed.
