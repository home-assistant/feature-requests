        Example: The current automation documentation is fragmented - triggers, conditions, and actions are explained separately, making it hard for new users to understand how they work together. I'd like to see a new "Automation Cookbook" section with real-world examples like "Turn on lights when arriving home after sunset" or "Send notifications when doors are left open." Each example would show the complete YAML with explanations of why each part is needed, progressing from simple to advanced scenarios.
