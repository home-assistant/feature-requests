        This form is for **crazy, experimental, or early-stage ideas** that might reshape how we think about home automation.
        
        Don't worry about:
        - Whether it's technically feasible right now
        - If it fits into existing categories
        - Whether anyone else has suggested it
        
        We want to hear your creative vision for the future of Home Assistant!
