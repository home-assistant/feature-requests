      description: What Matter or Thread feature would you like to see?
      placeholder: |
        Example: I'd like support for Matter-enabled refrigerators like the Samsung Family Hub series. My fridge supports Matter but only shows up as a basic device in Home Assistant. I want to see temperature sensors for different compartments, door open/close sensors, water filter status, and be able to control features like ice maker and water dispenser.
