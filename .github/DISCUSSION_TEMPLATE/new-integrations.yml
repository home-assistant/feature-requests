        ## Before you submit
        
        This form is **ONLY** for requesting a brand new integration that doesn't exist yet.
        
        **This is NOT for:**
        - 🐛 Reporting bugs in existing integrations → [Report an issue](https://github.com/home-assistant/core/issues/new/choose)
        - 🆘 In need for support? → [Community Forum](https://community.home-assistant.io) or join our [Discord chat server](https://discord.gg/c5DvZ4e). You are more likely to get the answer you are looking for in those places.
        - ➕ Adding device compatibility or new features to existing integrations → Use the "Integration enhancements" category
        - 📦 Requesting third-party integrations to become built-in → If a custom integration exists (for example, via HACS), we consider the request resolved
        - 🔧 Issues with built-in integrations → [Report here](https://github.com/home-assistant/core/issues/new/choose)
        - 🎨 Issues & feature requests with third-party integrations (for example, from HACS) → Report to the custom integration author/project directly
