## 🙋 How to request a feature

Writing a good feature request takes a bit of time—and that's a good thing! The more detail you provide, the easier it is for others to understand your idea, see the value, and potentially pick it up. Explain your use case, why it's important, and what you’ve tried so far.

1. First, [search the existing discussions](https://github.com/home-assistant/feature-requests/discussions) to see if your idea has already been suggested. If so, consider [voting instead](#️-vote-instead-of-duplicating).
2. If not, open the [Discussions tab](https://github.com/home-assistant/feature-requests/discussions).
3. Carefully select the category that best matches your feature request (e.g., for mobile app features, choose the appropriate mobile app category).
4. Fill in the form with as much relevant detail as possible.
4. Clearly explain your idea:
   - What problem does it solve?
   - What’s your proposed solution?
   - Why is it important to you?
   - Are there any alternatives or workarounds?

## 🗳️ Vote instead of duplicating

Before creating a new discussion, search for existing feature requests. If you find one you like or agree with, use the **upvote arrow** at the top of the post or share your use case in the thread. This helps us understand what the community values most.

## 📌 Keep in mind

- Not all feature requests will be implemented.
- We focus on ideas that align with our [values](https://www.openhomefoundation.org/): local control, privacy, choice, and sustainability.
- Home Assistant is an open source project powered by volunteers and contributors working in their spare time.
- Please respect everyone involved, and be mindful of the time and energy others have invested. Behind every contribution is a person.
- This space is covered by our [Code of Conduct](https://www.home-assistant.io/code_of_conduct/).
- Proposals should be realistic and actionable.
- Inactive or out-of-scope discussions may be closed.
- Not everything has to be solved within Home Assistant itself—some feature requests may be addressed by third-party projects like custom integrations, dashboard cards, or add-ons.
